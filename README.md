# Cotton Disease Classification using Transfer Learning with InceptionV3

## Overview
This project aims to classify images of cotton plants into different disease categories using transfer learning with the InceptionV3 architecture. Transfer learning involves leveraging pre-trained models to solve similar problems efficiently by reusing learned features.

## Project Structure
- **Importing Libraries**: Necessary libraries such as TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, glob, and Matplotlib are imported.
- **Setting Image Size**: Images are resized to 224x224 pixels, as required by the InceptionV3 model.
- **Loading InceptionV3 Model**: The InceptionV3 model pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset is loaded without the top layer.
- **Freezing Layers**: All layers in the InceptionV3 model are frozen to prevent them from being trained again.
- **Adding Custom Layers**: Custom layers are added on top of the InceptionV3 model for classification.
- **Compiling the Model**: The model is compiled with categorical cross-entropy loss and the Adam optimizer.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Image data generators are used to preprocess and augment the training and testing images.
- **Loading Training and Testing Data**: Training and testing data are loaded using flow_from_directory method.
- **Model Training**: The model is trained using the fit_generator method with the specified number of epochs.
- **Plotting Loss and Accuracy**: Loss and accuracy curves are plotted for visualization.
- **Making Predictions**: The model is used to make predictions on the testing set.
- **Saving Predictions**: Predictions are saved for further analysis.

## Results
- The model achieved high accuracy on both the training and testing sets.
- Loss and accuracy curves indicate that the model is not overfitting.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the effectiveness of transfer learning in classifying cotton plant diseases using the InceptionV3 architecture. The trained model can be deployed in real-world applications for early detection and management of cotton diseases, contributing to sustainable agriculture practices.

## Future Improvements
- Fine-tuning the model by unfreezing some layers for further improvement.
- Experimenting with different pre-trained models and hyperparameters.
- Collecting more diverse and extensive datasets to improve model generalization.
